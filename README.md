# Rock Band 3 Pro Drums Lessons transcription for Clone Hero

## Overview

I am learning drums, and I found that the lessons from the Rock Band 3 could be very useful for developing coordination, timing, and basic groove control.

This repository contains my attempt to transcribe the entire tutorial into MIDI and then convert it into playable Clone Hero songs.

## How to Use

1. Download [this](https://github.com/marcusnizalvarez/Rb3DrumLessons/releases/download/v1.0/Rb3ProDrumLessons.zip) release.
2. Copy the **`Pro Drum Lessons`** folder into your Clone Hero songs directory.
3. Scan songs in Clone Hero.
4. Play.

## Clone Hero Practice Features

- I added section events to the converted MIDI files.
- **This allows each exercise to appear as a separate section in Clone Hero’s practice mode**.
- You can loop any exercise indefinitely, which is ideal for focused practice.

## Notes on the Transcription

- **`full_transcription.mid`** contains the full transcription of the tutorial in MIDI format (not as a Clone Hero chart, but as actual musical notation).
- I am a beginner drummer, so note lengths, grooves, and articulations may not be perfectly accurate.
- Feel free to review, correct, or improve the transcription. Contributions and fixes are very welcome.
- The original tutorial uses a continuous metronome, but I changed this to only a 4-beat count-in. This was a personal preference, as it helps me adapt better to Clone Hero’s highway timing.

## Missing Lessons

I do not own the original game, so I used this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y17RgQUOrcA) as reference. The video is almost complete but missing two lessons. To keep the lesson order consistent, I renamed so the sequence remains correctly ordered.
